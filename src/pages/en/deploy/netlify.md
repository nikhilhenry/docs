Your Astro project can be deployed to Netlify in three different ways: as a static site, a server-rendered site, or an edge-rendered site.

## Static Site Deployment

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You donâ€™t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Netlify! 


### Netlify Website UI

If your project is stored in GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps, you can use the Netlify website UI to "Add a new site" from your dashboard and choose to "import an existing project."

When you import your repository from your Git provider, Netlify will detect Astro projects automatically and pre-fill the configuration for you.

Make sure that the following settings are entered before hitting the "Deploy" button:

- **Build Command:** `astro build` or `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`

After deploying, you will redirected to the site overview page and you can edit the details of your site and see your preview and production deploy logs and previews.

Any future changes to your source repository will trigger preview and production deploys based on your deployment configuration.

### Netlify CLI

You can also create a new site on Netlify and link up your Git repository by installing and using the [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/).

After following the instructions to log in and authorize Netlify, and running `netlify init`, the CLI will then automatically detect the build settings (astro build), deploy directory (dist), and offer to automatically generate a `netlify.toml` file with those settings. 

Next, the CLI will add a deploy key to the repository, which means your site will be automatically rebuilt on Netlify every time you push a change to Git.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Deployment

To enable SSR in Astro on Netlify, install the Netlify adapter to your projectâ€™s dependencies.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @astrojs/netlify
```

Once your packages have been installed, add two new lines to your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file.

```diff
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/functions';

  export default defineConfig({
+   adapter: netlify(),
  });
```

With Netlify you can deploy from git, their web UI, or from the cli. Here we'll use the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) to deploy.

First build your site as normal:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates `netlify/functions/` which contains your SSR code. Deploying your site will deploy this function which contains all of your Astro pages ready to be rendered.

```bash
netlify deploy
```

After the deploy is complete it should provide you a preview URL to see your site.
